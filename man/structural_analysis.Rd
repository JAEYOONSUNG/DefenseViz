\description{
Functions for analyzing protein secondary structure (ProstT5) to estimate TRD parameters
}
\details{
Type I S subunits have a characteristic domain architecture:
\itemize{
\item Two TRD (Target Recognition Domain) regions at N and C termini
\item Central coiled-coil alpha-helical spacer between TRDs
\item Conserved N-repeat regions (NNNN patterns) flanking TRDs
}

The alpha-helix spacer length determines the distance between two half-sites
in the bipartite recognition sequence (e.g., AACNNNNNNGTGC where N is the spacer)

This module uses ProstT5 3-state secondary structure predictions (H=helix, E=strand, C=coil)
to estimate the alpha-helical spacer length and predict the N-repeat distance in recognition sequences.
