\usage{
detect_catalytic_motifs(
  data,
  seq_col = "translation",
  id_col = NULL,
  component_type = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with protein sequences}

\item{seq_col}{Column containing protein sequences}

\item{id_col}{ID column (auto-detect if NULL)}

\item{component_type}{"MTase", "REase", or "all"}
}
\value{
Tibble with motif detection results including positions
}
\description{
Searches for R-M catalytic motifs in protein sequences
and returns positions (start, end) for each match.

For MTase confirmation:
\itemize{
\item Must have at least one DPPY-family motif (catalytic site)
\item Must have at least one GxGxG-family motif (SAM-binding)
\item Both are required for high confidence MTase classification
}
}
